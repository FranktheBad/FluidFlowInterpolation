# FluidFlowInterpolation
The goal of this project is to make use of the power-law velocity function alongside Reynolds number information to make prediction of flow properties. Flow velocity is observed for differnt turbulent flow setups (different reynolds number) while varying radius of flow. Least square regression is used together with the Lagragian Interpolation technique to make appropraite predictions about the flows velocity at an unobserved turbulent flow setup (reynolds number).
See Notebook1.ipynb for elaborate desccription of problem and available dataset.

Algorithms Used
- Least Square Regression
- Lagrange Interpolation
